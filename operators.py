classwork
write a program that allows users to input their year of birth and it tells the user
whether they are born in a leep year

Hint
remember that a leap year occurs every 4 years
Therefore,leap years are divisible by 4
i.e when divided by 4 there will be on remainder

leap % 4 = 0

#     print('You are born in a leap year')
# else:
#     print('You are not born in a leap year')
